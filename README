A contrived example of nested calls so I can experiment with wiring up Rhino Stubs with StructureMap for the sake of running MSpec tests.

MainGate is a class library
  it holds IOne, and ITwo instance variables
   IOne instantiates an IEleven variable
      IEleven instantiates an IOneHundredOne variable

This project has 2 different clients that use MainGate:
1. ConsoleClient
  To run: 
    build the app from Visual Studio, 
    cd into the app\ClientConsole\bin\Debug directory
    execute the ClientConsole.exe file

2. The MSpec tests
  To run:
    cd into the bld\ directory
    run 'rake'  or 'rake test['html'] to create a rpt\specs.html file
