A contrived example of nested calls so I can experiment with wiring up Rhino Stubs with StructureMap for the sake of running MSpec tests.

MainGate is a class library
  it holds IOne, and ITwo instance variables
   IOne instantiates an IEleven variable
      IEleven instantiates an IOneHundredOne variable
